        I am a full stack PHP developer with a passion for pushing myself to learn new things. I always strive to
        stay up to date with modern practices in the web development industry. The industry moves at a break-neck
        speed and one must keep up with the pace. I enjoy working on projects in my spare time which is where the
        idea to design this website came from. At work, I mostly deal with PHP and JavaScript using a in-house PHP
        framework. I my spare time I enjoy learning new technologies and furthering my software development skill set.

        I started out creating this website to further my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills because in school most of the
        focus was not on web development. After getting a job as a full stack PHP developer, I decided I needed to hone
        my web development skills. This website was originally designed with Twitter's Bootstrap CSS framework and used
        jQuery. I have since ported the website over to the Laravel PHP framework. Bootstrap and jQuery are still used,
        and I have switched to webpack (using Laravel's mix tooling) to compile ES6 JavaScript to ES5 with babel and
        bundle everything up.

        I also have a project that I am working on called Expnsr that will be a RESTful API designed in Laravel for
        budget planning, checkbook management and bill reminders. The idea is to write the API and then use a front-end
        single page web application to consume the API, with the ability to eventually connect more clients to the API.
        If you would like to see the progress on the Expnsr API feel free to visit the
        <a href="https://github.com/brandon14/expnsr-api" target="_blank">
          Expnsr API on github
        </a>. It will be free and open source, and released under the MIT license. The source code for this website is
        also available free and open source <a href="https://github.com/brandon14/my-website" target="_blank">here</a>.
