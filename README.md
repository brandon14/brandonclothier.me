### Source code for https://brandonclothier.me

This is the source for my personal resume website located [here](https://brandonclothier.me)

It is written using the Laravel MVC fraework for PHP and uses Twitter
Bootstrap and jQuery on the front end. For now it is mostly a simple
mainly static website but I plan on expanding on the website and making
it more dynamic and add the ability to configure the website content from
an admin portal much like a WYSIWYG page.

This code is released under the MIT license.
